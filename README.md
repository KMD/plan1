# Plan 1

`version 0.1` (don't try to use it, is not even close to ready)

This is a task management system designed for [asynchronous work](https://asyncmanifesto.org). Its biggest advantages are:

1. It's incredibly simple, utilizing only HTML, CSS, PHP, and MySQL.
2. It's designed with the intention that you can use it with command-line web browsers like Lynx, Links, W3M, and likely others.
3. It looks decent on graphical web browsers, even old and primitive ones.
4. The source code is kept simple and straightforward, allowing you to easily tailor it to your needs.
5. There are no package managers or JavaScript required.
6. It will run everywhere.
